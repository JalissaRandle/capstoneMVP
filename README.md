# Capstone Idea 
My application  will be a website for a concert simular to Coachella and it will sell the concert tickets and let people buy backstage passes and merch. 

# MVPS
* User can view all of the different tickets and the different perks each ticket 
* User will be able to add tickets and merch to cart 
* User will be able to create an account

# Other ideas
